          Originating from southeastern Wisconsin, Walt Reid is an illustrator
          who works with ink and paint to make the fantastic seem possible. He
          spent his youth by firelight, sheltered from midwinter frosts playing
          board games with his cousins. There he was given an education in the
          bizarre and armed with an obsession for imaginary worlds: he’d take
          these to the Milwaukee Institute of Art and Design, graduating in 2025
          with a BFA in Illustration. His work has been featured in WYRD
          Magazine, a Milwaukee-based anthology of fantasy art. When he isn’t
          drawing, he’s most often found on a trail or in a book.
